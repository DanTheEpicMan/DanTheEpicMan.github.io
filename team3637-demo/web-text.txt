The season got off to a great start with the continued success of our two FIRST LEGO League teams. During pre-season, we showcased our robot at the 4H Fair, Community Day, and the Chamber of Commerce’s Business Expo. Shortly before kickoff, we were honored to be named as a runner-up for the Safety Animation Award. Also as a team, we completed over 1000 robotics outreach hours by the end of the year. During the composition season, we competed at Bridgewater, Montgomery, and the Mid-Atlantic District Championship at Lehigh University. We flew our way to the playoffs in both of our qualifying events. At Bridgewater, we won the "District Event Finalist" and the "Creativity Award" sponsored by Xerox. At Montgomery, we won the "Imagery Award" in honor of Jack Kamen. Finally, in the Mid-Atlantic District Championship, our hard work warranted us the "Creativity Award" once again. Our team is incredibly honored to have won these awards and continue to work hard to improve all aspects of our team for future years. 

2015-2016: STRONGHOLD

The Daleks catapulted into the 2015-2016 season. At the district competitions at Mount Olive and Montgomery High Schools, we ranked #3 and #2 respectively. The team qualified for the District competition for the second year in a row and attended the World Championships for the first time, where we won a Hard Hat Safety Pin. The team won the Imagery Award in honor of Jack Kamen at Mount Olive, and the Industrial Safety Award sponsored by Underwriters Laboratories at both Montgomery and the District Championships. The Daleks increased their outreach efforts in the fall of 2015 by forming and mentoring two FLL (FIRST LEGO League) teams in Hunterdon County. We maintained our work with two of the local elementary schools’ LEGO clubs, tutored at the Family Success Center, as well as participated in Relay for Life. Our presence in the community became stronger than ever, and by extension, so did the vision of FIRST. 
2014-2015: RECYCLE RUSH

In 2015, the Daleks shined even brighter. We advanced to the District Championships for the first time since 2012, and we were also Finalists in a District Event for the first time in team history. We expanded our scouting team and created a scouting app for use by our team members in the stands, which syncs to our new custom pit server. Our great successes were due to many factors, one of which was Hunterdon Central’s brand-new Robotics workroom. Team 3637’s successes went beyond the technical aspects. Our outreach efforts expanded to new levels—some activities included running Robotics workshops at the county library and Family Success Center, assisting the LEGO Club at both Desmares and Barley Sheaf Elementary School, and forming a successful “Relay for Life” team. 

2013-2014: AERIAL ASSIST

Team 3637 dove head first into the 2013-2014 season, and accomplished many feats. The Daleks made their first primarily offensive robot in less than six weeks, grew to a total of 45 members, and got a robotics class added to the Hunterdon Central curriculum. We competed in two Mid-Atlantic District Competitions, held at Mount Olive High School and Bridgewater-Raritan High School, and won the Chrysler Team Spirit Award at Mount Olive for our work in the community and overall team spirit. The team developed greatly in their skills and relationships.
2012-2013: ULTIMATE ASCENT

The Daleks entered 2013 determined to try new things and reach new heights in the process. Our experimentation included a focus on the endgame challenge, a partnership with Team 869, and pre-season workshops in anticipation of the build season. While we didn’t make it to the District Championships, we did achieve an impressive 30-point climb, and for our optimism and perseverance in the face of our many challenges, we brought home the Gracious Professionalism® award at the Bridgewater-Raritan District Competition. As in previous years, Team 3637 continued to grow, both in knowledge and experience as well as in membership. 

2011-2012: REBOUND RUMBLE

A larger organization than it had been in 2011, the Daleks reached new heights and new achievements. For the first time, we ranked in the top 50 teams after our first two competitions, qualifying to go to the MAR District Championships in Philadelphia. We also competed in our first off-season event (Brunswick Eruption) and were members of the winning alliance with Team 341 and Team 25. 
2010-2011: LOGO MOTION

During our rookie season, we competed at the New Jersey Regional in Trenton. After winning a “Rookie Inspiration Award” in this initial season, the team realized that it needed access to a fully outfitted workspace and lobbied successfully to work out of a shop classroom at Central during the nights and weekends of build season. This initial success was the beginning of engineering and STEM extracurricular activities being offered at our high school.


Outreach Events:
STEM Curriculum

This innovative curriculum is designed to empower students with limited resources by utilizing step-by-step instructional videos available in both Portuguese and English that members of our team created. The curriculum covers essential online tools, including document creation, presentations, emails, and coding basics. By bridging language barriers and providing accessible resources, our team aims to democratize STEM education and empower students in Brazil to navigate the digital landscape. Thereby fulfilling our mission of fostering STEM locally, and making a difference globally. 

FLL & FLL Jr. Teams Mentored in Our Community

 The 5 FLL teams meet weekly at Flemington Presbyterian Church which offers their youth space through one of our team administrators. While our 4 adult coaches provide administrative oversight, our student mentors facilitate these meetings by providing instruction on programming, research, and presentation techniques. Daleks model leadership and adherence to Core Values as the FLL members grow into their roles on the team. This develops our FIRST pipeline, where middle school students are eager to continue their participation in FIRST by joining our FRC team or FTC programs in the area. 

Grow-a-Row

Our team organized a meaningful outreach event named "Grow-Row," where we actively participated in harvesting cabbage to provide essential food resources for the underprivileged. Through collective effort, we successfully picked 500,000 cabbages. This initiative not only demonstrated our commitment to community service but also made a significant impact in addressing food insecurity by contributing to those in need. Our team takes pride in leveraging our skills and resources to make a positive difference and support the well-being of the underprivileged in our community.


Hunterdon County Library Makerspace

We also forged a valuable partnership with the Hunterdon County Library Maker Space, playing a pivotal role in setting up their new VEX Robot kits and subsequently conducting three enriching sessions of VEX Robotics. Particularly noteworthy was our engagement with homeschooled children aged 7-12, where our members served as mentors, guiding these eager learners through the intricacies of building and programming robots. This initiative proved instrumental in exposing 20 students to the captivating world of STEM, fostering their curiosity and igniting a passion for exploration and innovation.

Gingerbreadgineering

Our team organized a festive and educational outreach event called "Gingerbreadgineering" at the Flemington Presbyterian Church, infusing the holiday spirit with engaging Christmas-themed STEM activities. Participants had the opportunity to delve into hands-on projects, including crafting gingerbread houses, participating in a candy slingshot challenge, and constructing marshmallow igloos. Through this innovative event, we not only spread the joy of the season but also successfully promoted STEM education creatively and interactively, fostering a sense of excitement and curiosity within our local community.

School STEM Clubs

Nine years ago, we established a relationship with a local elementary school; Barley Sheaf Elementary School, to mentor their after-school STEM clubs. This initiative was so successful that we expanded to even more local elementary schools. These partnerships have allowed us to nurture an excitement for STEM in hundreds of young children. Our increased focus on outreach and service inspired our student leaders to establish a service expectation for all members. The team has developed a diverse outreach program including STEM mentorship, demonstrations, and participation in other charitable programs. 

Independence Manor (STEM with Seniors)

Last year, we organized a collaborated event with a nearby assisted living facility for seniors, Independence Manor. Since COVID, many seniors in Independence Manor have been confined to their rooms, leading to isolation and a lack of exposure to the outside world. To increase their exposure to the outside world, we started a building club with the seniors that would not only bring entertainment to the seniors but also help them stay active. Additionally our team has established our STEM For Seniors initiative. Our outreach collaboration included the creation of modern technology such as drones and VEX robots. 

 

To expand on this initiative, this year our team created a STEM For Seniors Initiative – aimed at bridging the generational gap in technology education. Through this initiative we partnered with United Way teaching hands-on workshops breaking down complex concepts into simple, accessible lessons such as drone building. Through hands-on engagement with these projects, residents have had the opportunity to solve and socially interact with others.

Other Events and Drives

Our team actively engages with the community through a series of impactful robot demonstrations at various events, including the 4-H fair, a prominent local fair, back-to-school night, and Makers Day. These outreach events serve as dynamic platforms to promote our team, showcasing our technological innovations and fostering enthusiasm for STEM fields. By participating in these diverse community events, we not only demonstrate our robot's capabilities but also actively contribute to the promotion and awareness of our team, reinforcing our commitment to STEM education and community engagement.

On November 7th, The Daleks picked beets at a local Grow-a-Row farm. Grow-a-Row is a national organization based in Hunterdon County that grows and donates fresh produce across America, aiding families affected by food insecurity. Alongside growing, they also apply sustainable farming techniques, reduce food waste, and educate the community on the importance of healthy habits. Grow-a-row sprouted in 2002 when founder Chip Paillex and his daughter first donated their produce surplus to the Flemington Food Pantry. After seeing the huge impact made by this small gesture, they decided to go bigger. Now, Grow-a-Row farms span across 423 acres, producing millions of servings every year. On that Friday specifically, the Daleks contributed to over 10,500 pounds of donated produce, equaling to 40,000 servings. But as Chip Paillex said “It’s not about the pounds - It always has and always will be about the people.” The Daleks are grateful for the opportunities that Grow-a-Row has provided for the past 3 years, and are looking forward to continue making a difference, one vegetable at a time.
