<pre>
Not formatitng this page because it is basically ment only for people maintaining the website:

I assume you know a little bit about HTML and CSS, if not ask AI or something, its really simple

Imporant things while teaching: 
Use backslash to make an explosion appear on screen (usefull for emphasizing a point)
When teaching people, avoid covering all of the nuances of a function, notice how I mainly use x = x + 1 instead of 
something like x += 1 or x++. This is simpelly becuase most of this type of stuff can be learned later on.
Thrusting a log of newance on new memebers will lead to them feelling overwhelmed and quitting.

People dont pay attention to what you are saying, thats why this is filled with so many code snippets and
embede pracice, thats the only way to learn.

Along with that, people always forget what they tell you witch is why I implemented the cheat-sheet on the right 
side of the screen. Now people can look over to get the answer and it renforces the solution in thier mind.

Website Editing:
As you can see its all just simple html with mininal CSS and very little JS.
styling goes as follows:

Tags Used:
Title: &lt;h1&gt; title &lt;/h1&gt;
Subtitles: &lt;h3&gt; subheader &lt;/h3&gt;
Text: &lt;p&gt; text &lt;/p&gt;
Inline code: &lt;code&gt; inline code &lt;/code&gt;
Multi-line code: &lt;div class="code-box"&gt; code &lt;/div&gt;


Embed:
Done with jdoodle
go into the account, make a new project, click the share button, at the buttom of the menue, click embed 
copy the lines of code between the body tags.

paste the lines in where you want the embed to be.

<b>Presenting:
You already know about the explosion button to emphasize points

You also could use a lazerpointer, if your using KDE plasma, you can use KDE connect in presenting mode.</b>
